# The App to Query, Retrieve, and Update Database

This folder contains the source code of the (minimal) application that allows user interaction with the database.

From the SFILS parent directory (where the 'app', 'docs', and other folders are located) run 'python -m app.app' to open the app in command prompt. Make sure the MySQL server is running, and that the csv_conversion.py script has been successfully run beforehand. For more detailed instructions, see the README.md in the 'docs' folder.
